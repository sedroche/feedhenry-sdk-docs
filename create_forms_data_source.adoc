= Dynamically Populating Form Fields From an MBaaS Service

[[dynamically-populating-form-fields-from-an-mbaas-service-overview]]
== Overview

You can use an endpoint of an MBaaS service as the data source for a form field in the Forms Builder.
This guide shows you how to create the MBaaS service, define the data source, and populate a form field using the data source.

See link:{MobileDeveloperGuide}#using-data-sources[Using Data Sources] for more information on data sources for Forms.

== Creating a Service for a Data Source

To define a data source, you must provide an MBaaS service endpoint which serves valid JSON responses for the data source.
In this example, you'll create a new MBaaS service which serves static data from a JSON file.

. In the Studio, navigate to __Services & APIs__. Click __Provision MBaaS Service/API__.
. On the left, choose the _Data Sources_ category.
. Select a template. For example, __Static Data Source__.
. Choose a name for the service and deploy it to an environment.

== Defining a Data Source

Once you've created the MBaaS service providing the data, you can now use it in a data source.

. In the Studio, navigate to __Drag & Drop Apps > Data Sources__. Click __New Data Source__.

. Set a name and a description. Both are required.

. Choose the previously created MBaaS service and its endpoint to use as the data source.
+
The _Static Data Source_ template used in this example serves data at the endpoint `/static_ds/months`.
+
You can check, whether the service returns data valid for use as a data source, using the _Validate_ button.
Before the validation, make sure the correct environment is selected using the environment selector in the top right-hand corner.
+
If the data is valid, you'll see the message __"**Success** Data Source Is Valid"__.
If the data is not valid, or the service can not be reached, an error message will indicate the problem.
+
After a successful validation, you can view the returned data using the _View_ button.
+

. Choose an update frequency – how often the configured MBaaS service endpoint will be called to obtain new data.
The update frequency is a value in the range of 1 minute to 7 days.

. Choose how many responses from calls to the MBaaS service endpoint should be kept in the audit log.

. Click __Create Data Source__.
You will see the message __Data Source Created Successfully__.

Now, the data source can be used in the Forms Builder to populate a form field.

== Using a Data Source in a Form Field

After defining the data source, you can now use it in the Forms Builder.

. In the Studio, navigate to __Drag & Drop Apps > Forms Builder__.
. Open an existing form, or create a new form. Navigate to __Edit Form__.
. Drag one of the supported types into the form – for example, a _Dropdown_ field. Select the created field.
. In the _Options_ section, check __Use a Data Source to populate field options?__.
. Select the data source created in the previous step.

+
If a selected data source has loaded data at least once before – for example, while validating during creation – the last available version of the data will be displayed in the field options, as a preview.
+
Use the environment selector in the top right-hand corner to ensure that the same environment is selected, where the MBaaS service of the data source is deployed.

. Save and deploy the form.

If you navigate to the __Dashboard__, you can now see the field populated by data from the data source in the preview on the right.
